                <li>Java – Java is the official language of Android development and is supported by Android Studio. </li>
                <li>Kotlin – Kotlin was recently introduced as a secondary ‘official’ Java language. </li>
                <li>C/C++ – Android Studio also supports C++ with the use of the Java NDK. </li>
                <li>BASIC – A bonus option is to learn BASIC and try the B4A IDE from Anywhere Software. </li>
                <li>Corona/LUA – Another cross-platform tool build on LUA. It massively simplifies the app-building process and a
                    llows you to call native libraries. </li>
                <li>PhoneGap (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) – If you already know how to build interactive web pages, then you can use this knowledge with PhoneGap to build a more basic cross-platform app </li>

    <div class="left" align="justify" >Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on a modified version o
        f the Linux kernel
        and other open source software and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphone
        and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS
        for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital
        cameras, PCs and other electronics.

        Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first commercial
        Android device launched in September 2008. The operating system has since gone through multiple major releases, with the
        current version being 8.1 "Oreo", released in December 2017. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source
        Project (AOSP), and is primarily licensed under the Apache License.

        Android is also associated with a suite of proprietary software developed by Google, including core apps for services
        such as Gmail and Google Search, as well as the application store and digital distribution platform Google Play, and
        associated development platform. These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards
        imposed by Google, but AOSP has been used as the basis of competing Android ecosystems, such as Amazon.com's Fire OS,
        which utilize their own equivalents to the Google Mobile Services.

        Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets.
